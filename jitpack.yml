# Jitpack times out if we try to do a full build with all Spigot dependencies. Also, Jitpack fails
# to find our build artifacts if we build any Spigot dependencies (either in before_install,
# install, or triggered via a Gradle Exec task). We therefore only build the api project.
# If we were to build the Spigot dependencies again in the future, we need to manually delete these
# artifacts again after the build to avoid Jitpack from publishing them.
