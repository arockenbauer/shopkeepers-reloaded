/**
 * The {@link NPCAddTraitEvent} and {@link NPCRemoveTraitEvent} don't provide the player who adds or
 * removes the trait. We require the player to be able to send feedback messages about the creation
 * and deletion of the corresponding shopkeeper.
 * <p>
 * We therefore handle trait additions and removals deferred and additionally react to the
 * {@link NPCTraitCommandAttachEvent} (called <b>after</b> a player added a trait via command) and
 * the {@link PlayerCreateNPCEvent} (called when a player creates a NPC via command, which might
 * result in traits, specified in the NPC creation command, getting added <b>afterwards</b>) to try
 * to (heuristically) figure out the player responsible for adding or removing the trait.
 * <p>
 * Unfortunately there are no Citizens events for when a player removes a trait or NPC. If we cannot
 * determine the player who is adding or removing the trait, we still create or delete the
 * corresponding shopkeeper, but no player receives any feedback messages about it.
