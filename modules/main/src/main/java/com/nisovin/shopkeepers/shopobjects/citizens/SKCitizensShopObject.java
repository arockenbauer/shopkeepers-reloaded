/**
 * A shop object that is represented by a Citizens NPC.
 * <p>
 * Citizens NPCs might move around, be teleported even when they are not yet spawned, or change
 * their location while the Shopkeepers plugin is not running. This shop object will try to
 * dynamically adopt the NPC's current (possibly stored) location whenever this shop object is
 * loaded, the Citizens plugin is dynamically enabled or reloads its NPCs, the NPC is spawned or
 * teleported, or this shop object is ticked or ends ticking and detects that the NPC has moved.
 * <p>
 * However, there is one exception to this: If the NPC's world is currently not loaded, the NPC
 * provides no stored location, and we can therefore not differentiate between whether the NPC's
 * world is currently not loaded, or whether the NPC has not yet been spawned at all. In the latter
 * case, we may want to spawn the NPC once the shopkeeper's chunk is loaded and activated.
 * Consequently, if the shopkeeper's last known chunk is activated and the shop object starts
 * ticking, but the NPC still provides no stored (and loaded) location, we will spawn the NPC at the
 * shopkeeper's location, and might thereby teleport the NPC from its previous, but no longer loaded
 * location, to the shopkeeper's location.
