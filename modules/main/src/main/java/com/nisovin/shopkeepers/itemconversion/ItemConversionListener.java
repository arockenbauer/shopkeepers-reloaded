	// Notes regarding converting items on more circumstances with the goal of fixing item stacking
	// issues:
	// - We cannot use InventoryOpenEvent here because this does not get triggered for when a player
	// opens his own inventory (this is client side only).
	// - It is also not possible to catch all situations in which a player can receive an item
	// (consider for example other plugins or commands directly adding items to the player's
	// inventory).
	// - The item conversion is not cheap performance wise. We therefore don't want to run it too
	// frequently or under too many circumstances.
	//
	// We therefore don't even attempt to achieve fixing item stacking related issues and instead
	// limit ourselves to issues related to shopkeeper trading.
