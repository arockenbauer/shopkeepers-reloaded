/**
 * A user interface instance that represents a {@link UISession} and handles the user interactions

 * <p>
 * A {@link View} is responsible for setting up, opening, and handling the interactions with an
 * underlying {@link InventoryView} for a player. Once opened, the {@link View} is only valid as
 * long as the underlying {@link InventoryView} is still valid. If the view wants to open a new
 * {@link InventoryView} in response to a user interaction, the new {@link InventoryView} is
 * represented by a new {@link View} instance. Any state that should be preserved between the views
 * needs to be passed to the new {@link View}, for example in the form of a {@link UIState}.
 * <p>
 * A {@link View} is associated with the {@link #getProvider() ViewProvider} that instantiated it,
 * which also provides information about the its {@link ViewProvider#getContext() view context}: The
 * context can be any arbitrary object, but is usually the primary object for which the view is
 * visualizing data or providing controls. The context can be used to query the active views that
 * share the same context, for example to update each other.

	 * Shift double left-clicks are supposed to move all matching items to the other inventory.
	 * Minecraft implements this by triggering a shift left-click with
	 * {@link InventoryAction#MOVE_TO_OTHER_INVENTORY} for all inventory slots that contain a

	 * We assume that any shift left-clicks that occur within
	 * {@link #AUTOMATIC_SHIFT_LEFT_CLICK_NANOS} on a slot different to the previously clicked slot
	 * are automatically triggered.
	 * <p>
	 * Limitations (TODO): We cannot use a much lower time span (e.g. limiting it to 1 or 2 ticks),
	 * because the automatically triggered clicks may arrive quite some time later (up to 150 ms
	 * later on a local server and possibly more with network delay involved). Also, this does not
	 * work for automatic clicks triggered for the same slot. Since the automatically triggered
	 * clicks may arrive quite some time later, we cannot differentiate them from manual fast
	 * clicking.
