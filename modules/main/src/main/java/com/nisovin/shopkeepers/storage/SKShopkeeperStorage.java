/**
 * Storage responsible for persisting and loading the data of shopkeepers.
 * <p>
 * Implementation notes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>There can at most be one thread doing file IO at the same time.
 * <li>Saving preparation always happens on the server's main thread. At most one save can be
 * prepared and processed at the same time.
 * <li>If there is a request for another <b>async</b> save while an async save is already in
 * progress, a flag is set to indicate that another save needs to take place once the current async
 * save completes.
 * <li>If there is a request for a <b>sync</b> save while an async save is already in progress, the
 * main thread waits for the async save to finish (or aborts it), before preparing the next save.
 * <li>It is not safe to externally edit the save file while the plugin is running, because the
 * plugin might still store unsaved shopkeeper data in memory or overwrite the save file with new
 * contents at any time.
 * </ul>
