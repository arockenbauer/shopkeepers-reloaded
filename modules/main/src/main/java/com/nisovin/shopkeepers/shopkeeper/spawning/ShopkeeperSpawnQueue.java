/**
 * A queue for load balancing the spawning of shopkeepers.
 * <p>
 * Spawning shopkeepers can be relatively costly performance-wise. In order to avoid performance
 * drops when chunks with lots of shopkeepers are activated, we use this queue to distribute the
 * spawning of shopkeepers over several ticks.
 * <p>
 * Shopkeepers may already be ticked while they are still pending to be spawned. Shop objects can
 * use {@link AbstractShopObject#isSpawningScheduled()} to check if they are currently still pending
 * to be spawned.
