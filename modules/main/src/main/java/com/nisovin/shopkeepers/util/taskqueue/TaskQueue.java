/**
 * A {@link BukkitScheduler} task that processes a queue of work units.
 * <p>
 * A {@link TaskQueue} has two main characteristics: The rate at which the task executes and can
 * therefore process pending work units, and how many of these work units it processes per
 * execution. The chosen execution rate and the number of processed work units per execution are a
 * balance between the following considerations:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The number of work units processed per execution has to remain low enough to avoid
 * performance drops.
 * <li>More frequent execution rates have lower latencies for work units to be processed, balance
 * the load across more ticks, and can process more work units per time unit while still avoiding
 * performance drops. However, they are also associated with have a higher general performance
 * overhead (more processing done by the scheduler, more task invocations, the queue is checked more
 * often, etc.).
 * <li>Frequently canceling and restarting the task is also associated with a notable overhead,
 * which is why we keep the task running, even when there are no pending work units. A high
 * execution rate therefore produces more overhead in comparison to the actual useful work being
 * done when the queue of pending work units is empty most of the time.
 * <li>The queue should have a high enough throughput so that it can cope with the rate and peaks at
 * which new work units are typically produced, without causing disruptions due to other components
 * or users having to wait for these work units to be processed.
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <T>
 *            the type of work units

	// Note: In comparison to a linked list, ArrayDeque is more cache friendly, requires one less
	// reference lookup to retrieve elements, and produces less objects and therefore garbage
	// collection overhead.
	// However, in order to more efficiently remove work units from the queue again (ArrayDeque has
	// to move elements when removing an element from the middle), an idea has been to set the
	// element to null and then ignore null elements when processing work units. Since ArrayDeque
	// doesn't support null elements, this would either require our own implementation of
	// ArrayDeque, or we would have to store separate 'Entry' objects which then hold the references
	// to the work units. To not wastefully create and throw away these Entry objects, a second
	// ArrayDeque could be used as cache for unused Entry objects.
	// However, this would negate some of the benefits of using an ArrayDeque in the first place:
	// It's less cache friendly (the Entry objects require their own memory and may be distributed
	// across the memory), and adding, removing, and retrieving elements is slightly more costly.
	// This has not yet been benchmarked (TODO), but taking the following additional considerations
	// into account (specific to how we use this queue though), we simply keep using ArrayDeque as
	// it is for now:
	// - Accessing (and searching through) elements is cache friendly.
	// - Moving array elements is highly optimized.
	// - We expect the queue to remain relatively small in size, so moving elements is probably not
	// that costly.
	// - We expect actual removals to occur relatively infrequently (whereas checking if the queue
	// contains an element that needs to be removed may occur comparatively more often).
